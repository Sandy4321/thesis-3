\label{conclusion}

Through the use of tight theoretical bounds and clever data structure optimizations, we are able to find and certify the optimal rule list on real-world problems.
This idea of deterministically finding the optimal rule list has been around for a while, but it has not been feasible until recently.
Due to dramatic increases in processor speed and computer memory, discrete optimization techniques can be applied to real problems and complete them in a reasonable amount of time.
Our novel bounds and use of branch-and-bound technique applied to the problem of discovering the optimal rule list show the renewed usefulness of applying discrete optimization approaches to problems.
Further optimizations involving distance sensitive hashing and bit-packing could reduce runtime and memory usage even further.
