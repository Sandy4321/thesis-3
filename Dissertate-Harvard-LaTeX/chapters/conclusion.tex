%TODO expand on conclusion
Through the use of tight theoretical bounds and clever data structure optimizations, we are able to find and certify the optimal rule list on real-world problems.
Discrete optimization has become less popular as other techniques such as convex optimization dominate the machine learning landscape.
However, we showed that due to dramatic increases in processor speed and computer memory, discrete optimization techniques can be applied to real problems and complete them in a reasonable amount of time.
In particular, we hope that this work will inspire further work on discrete optimization techniques for other methods such as decision trees or SVMs.

Other rule list methods are close to optimal.

We also showed that memory reduction

%This idea of deterministically finding the optimal rule list has been around for a while, but it has not been feasible until recently.
%Our novel bounds and use of branch-and-bound technique applied to the problem of discovering the optimal rule list show the renewed usefulness of applying discrete optimization approaches to problems.

Further optimizations involving distance sensitive hashing and bit-packing could reduce runtime and memory usage even further.
