We demonstrate a new algorithm that finds an optimal rule list as well as providing proof of that optimality. Rule lists, which are lists composed of If-Then statements, are similar to decision tree classifiers and are useful because each step in the model's decision making process is understandable by humans. Our algorithm, called CORELS, finds the optimal rule list through the use of three types of bounds: bounds inherent to the rules themselves, bounds based on the current best solution, and bounds based on symmetry between rule lists. We propose novel data structures to minimize the memory usage and runtime of our algorithm on this exponentially difficult problem. One advantage of our algorithm is that it generates not only the optimal rule list and a certificate of optimality, but also the entire solution space of nearly optimal solutions. Our algorithm therefore allows for the analysis and discovery of all optimal and near-optimal solutions on problems requiring human-interpretable algorithms.
