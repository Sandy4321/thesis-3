This thesis describes joint work with Elaine Angelino, Margo Seltzer, Cynthia Rudin, and Daniel Alabi.
Margo has been my advisor, professor, boss, and research supervisor and I cannot thank her enough for all her mentorship and advice.
In particular, she has helped my interest in research blossom, introduced me to this specific research project, and has guided me throughout the process of writing a thesis.
I would not have been able to write this thesis if not for her help.
I would also like to thank Elaine for her encouragement and guidance on this project, as well as her patience with my questions and inexperience.

I would like to thank all of my friends for their support, especially my blockmates CJ Christian, Juanky Perdomo, Renan Carneiro, Matthew DiSorbo, and Demren Sinik.
I also want to thank my brothers Micah Stone and Jeremy Larus for being there from day 0.
Last, but certainly not least, I need to thank my parents James Larus and Diana Stone.
Their continual love, support, and advice has been invaluable---not just throughout the thesis writing process---but throughout my entire life.
