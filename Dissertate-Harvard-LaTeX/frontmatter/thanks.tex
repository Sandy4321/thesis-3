This thesis describes joint work with Elaine Angelino, Margo Seltzer, Cynthia Rudin, and Daniel Alabi.
Margo has been my advisor, professor, boss, and research supervisor and I cannot thank her enough for all her mentorship and advice.
In particular, she has encouraged my interest in research, introduced me to this specific research project, and has guided me throughout the process of writing a thesis.
I would not have been able to write this thesis if not for her help.
I would also like to thank Elaine for her encouragement and guidance on this project, as well as her patience with my questions and inexperience.
I would like to thank all of my friends for their support, especially my blockmates---CJ Christian, Juanky Perdomo, Renan Carneiro, Matthew DiSorbo, and Demren Sinik.
Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my brothers Micah Stone and Jeremy Larus and my parents James Larus and Diana Stone for their continual love, support, and advice.
